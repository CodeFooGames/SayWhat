First release of swm private message command
swm sends an abbreviation to a list of players.
For example, "swm help player1 player2", plays back the "help" abbreviation as a private message
to "player1" and "player2".

* Fixed a bug where the InMyHand token expander crashed when a player had nothing in their hand.

Added support for variables
Variables let you put server and player information into abbreviations.
For example, using the "swr" command to record: "swr help I need help! At %%myloc!"
can use the "sw help" command to playback "I need help! At  x:-135, z:252, y:68".
